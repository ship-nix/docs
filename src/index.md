**Shipnix** is a web UI for hosting **NixOS** servers on DigitalOcean.

Shipnix is built for self-hosting with NixOS. giving you immutable, deterministic configurations versioned by git.

We believe NixOS is just as god an abstraction, if not better, than most managed platforms, and with less platform risk.

Our focus is to deliver a NixOS experience that is as vanilla as possible, and build _around_ NixOS, not make a UI that replaces already declarative code.
