Having your use the secure **https://** protocol is pretty much mandatory for any modern web service. This requires a SSL/TLS certificate.

This is easy to fix declaratively via your NixOs configuration.

## How to enable

Find your Nginx declaration (usually on `site.nix`).

If you use one of the starters that come with ship-nix, you will find the variable `httpsEnabled` at the top.

Change this to `true`, commit, push and click the `Deploy` button on your server dashboard.

```diff-nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
let
  # TODO: Enable SSL/HTTPS when your domain records are hooked up
  # By enabling SSL, you accept the terms and conditions of LetsEncrypt
- httpsEnabled = false;
+ httpsEnabled = true;
in
{
...
}
```

For a demo of how it works, look at this example

- [Using ACME certificates in Nginx (NixOS manual)](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#module-security-acme-nginx)

Explore the nginx options on NixOS

- [Nginx configurations options on nixos.org](https://search.nixos.org/options?query=services.nginx)

## When adding certificates fail

Your domain record must be fully propagated to point to your server. So the first job will be to [hook up your server with domain records](/servers/add-domain).

If you encounter a warning like this, it probably means your domain records are not yet fully propagated, but it doesn't hurt to double check your records.

Your NixOS configuration will fail. If that happens, just re-disable https and try to enable it a bit later.
