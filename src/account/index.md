## User dashboard

You manage account data and manage github login in in your <a target="_blank" href="https://ship-nix.com/ShowUser">user dashboard</a>.

## Deleting your account

You can delete your user from the dashboard. This also deletes all your data associated with ship-nix. **We can not recover this data.**

Your servers remain intact on your server provider after deleting your account.

**You must make sure you have SSH access from your computer to your server so you don`t lose access.**

Other stuff that gets deleted:

- Your custom NixOS images uploaded by ship-nix
- Deploy keys that where created via ship-nix if you use the Github integration
