To be able to develop locally, you need to have Nix installed and flakes enabled.

It's also highly recommended to install direnv for the best developer experience.

## Install Nix

[Follow the instructions on NixOS.org](https://NixOS.org/download.html#download-nix) to install Nix on your machine.

If you are already running NixOS on your desktop, you're of course all good ðŸ˜Š

## Enable flakes

Flakes are still considered an experimental feature in NixOS, so you will have to enable them.

NixOS wiki has [instructions on how to enable flakes](https://NixOS.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes).

## Direnv

Direnv is a shell extension that enables you to load up you nix environment in the shell of your project directory.

It provides the best developer experience for most starters.

There are two steps for installing direnv. **Installing it on your system** and **hooking up your shell**.

You can install direnv in your favorite package manager Nix ðŸ˜—
